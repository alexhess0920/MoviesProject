# Hi! This is a practice project I created using Python. I wanted to explore the potential correlations that impact gross box office earnings for movies.
# Here I do a bit of data cleaning and formatting to make sure my dataset is usable, consistent, and standardized. Then I create a hypothesis of which values
# I think will correlate strongly to gross earnings. From there, I get to work trying to prove or disprove my hypothesis using different functions and plots.
# Finally, I detail whether my hypothesis was proven correct or disproven.
